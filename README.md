# ECE220

## Description
This repository contains my code for ECE220 (Computer Systems & Programming) during Spring 2024. ECE220 is my favorite course this semester, covering a wide range of topics, from assembly language (LC3) to C, and finally, the essential concepts in C++. The lectures cover necessary concepts and leave room for self-learning and exploration. The MPs are challenging yet rewarding, helping to apply the concepts in practical scenarios. They also develop skills in using tools like GDB and LLDB. I hope you enjoy the material.

## Usage
You are supposed to write all your code independently. If you use any part of my code, please adhere to the academic integrity policies of UIUC and ZJUI. For instance, if you use my code from MP1 in your MP3, follow the instructions from your instructors. Any misuse of these files that violates the UIUC Academic Integrity policy is the responsibility of **you**. If any academic integrity issues arise, I will cooperate fully with UIUC or ZJU staff. If my actions violate the policies of UIUC or ZJUI, please contact me at siyuan1.23@intl.zju.edu.cn.

## Support
If you need any help, please feel free to contact me at siyuan1.23@intl.zju.edu.cn. I am more than willing to help in any way I can.

## Contribution
If you find any bugs (there likely are), please contact me at siyuan1.23@intl.zju.edu.cn. I appreciate your kindness and will add you to the acknowledgment list.

## Authors and acknowledgment
All materials belong to the instructors of ECE220 (Computer Systems & Programming): Pavel Loskot, Yu Xinbo, and Steven Lumetta at the ZJU-UIUC Institute.

I would like to express my gratitude to Prof. Loskot for patiently answering my questions and to Prof. Lumetta for developing such a high-quality course and MPs.
