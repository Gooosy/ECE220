Functionality (70%)
 DIJKSTRA
o 5/5 - initializes tables correctly
o 10/10 - inserts source node correctly into heap
o 5/5 - uses GET_CLOSEST to obtain next closest node and terminates correctly when heap is empty
o 5/5 - skips missing (distance "infinity") arcs
o 5/5 - computes distance through node being explored correctly
o 5/5 - compares distance with current distance (including "infinity") correctly
o 5/5 - relaxes distance correctly
o 5/5 - inserts node at end of heap correctly when necessary
o 5/5 - calls PERCOLATE_UP correctly
 program
o 5/5 - calls DIJKSTRA correctly
o 10/10 - uses FILL_STACK and PRINT_PATH correctly to print all shortest paths
o 5/5 - terminates correctly
